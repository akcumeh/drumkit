# Dicee Challenge

This is a solution to the [Drum Kit](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12383928) project in Section 13 of [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Dr. Angela Yu, available on Udemy. This is the fourth major project in the course. It mimics a drumkit set, with buttons onscreen that can be activated either by clicking or pressing keys - a great way to understand and event listeners in JavaScript, and further opportunity to toy with the Document Object Model.
